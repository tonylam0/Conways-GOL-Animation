# Conway's Game of Life Animation

A [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) based animation that gives a visual introduction to 
Conway's Game of Life, a famous cellular automaton. The animation is designed to intuitively
explain how simple rules can lead to complex behavior in a 2D grid of cells.


## What the Animation Covers
- What is a cell in a cellular automaton?
- How are cells represented?
    - Visual representation (white = alive, black = dead)
    - Binary Representation (1 = alive, 0 = dead)
- How is a cell's state updated?
- Conway's 3 fundamental state-changing rules:
    1. A live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies
    2. A live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies
    3. A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
